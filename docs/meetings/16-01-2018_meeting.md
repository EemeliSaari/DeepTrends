### Defining the research problem

Using the keyword detection & topic modelling:
- Analyze trends in the publications
- Data mining

> Unsupervised learning

**Steps to start with**:

1. Research into word2vector model by Mikolov et al.
2. Research count based models (bag of words ie.)

-> Look for the latest publications within the 5 year.

**Important things to look for:**
- Metric for comparing used methods
- Evaluation methods
- Common datasets that could be used

Draft the introduction based on the literature.

### Experimenting

Try out the frequency based methods in [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) as first stage.

-> Move to word2vector approach with [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/).

### Notes

>[Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) provides some starting point implementations for keypoint extraction as well.

>The research problem might get refined later on.
